To run this app:

You need to extract or clone the repo.

After that,

 cd mongo-simple-client_side

Ruby -version >= 2.0

Rails -version >= 4.0

you should have mongoDb installed,  if not and you are on Ubuntu:

You can install it by 

sudo apt-get install mongodb.

Then, you can run the app as

rails server and test it on http://localhost:3000.

It is a very simple form with no css and you just need to add user and in the attachment give a image of wrong size or try to upload a file of any other format, it will show you error, but it will reset the image which you attached.

Thank You
